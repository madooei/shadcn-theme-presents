# Roadmap for Shadcn Theme Presets

This document outlines the roadmap for the Shadcn Theme Presets project, detailing its current status, future plans, and key decisions made during development.

## Project Overview

The Shadcn Theme Presets project provides a comprehensive theming solution for shadcn/ui components. It offers over 40 pre-built theme presets, a React provider for theme management, a theme selector component, and utilities for dynamic theme switching. The project demonstrates best practices for React theme management, TypeScript integration, and Tailwind CSS theming.

## Current Status

### What's Complete âœ…

- **Theme Preset Collection**: 40+ pre-built theme presets with diverse color schemes
- **Theme Management System**: React provider and hooks for theme state management
- **Theme Selector Component**: Searchable dropdown interface for runtime theme switching
- **Theme Application Logic**: CSS custom properties-based theme application
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type definitions for theme presets and components
- **Build System**: tsup configuration for ESM/CJS dual builds with React JSX support
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library for theme functionality
- **Peer Dependencies**: Proper React, React-DOM, and shadcn/ui peer dependency setup
- **Example Applications**: Working examples with basic and advanced theme integration
- **Documentation System**: Comprehensive usage guides and integration examples

### In Progress ðŸš§

- **Store Optimization**: Updating the store to be more like the store of omni-themes (reduce dependencies, allow user select local storage key, provide logging with simple-logging)
- **Type Safety Enhancement**: Implementing an enum for theme presets to provide autocomplete and compile-time type safety when selecting presets
- **Architecture Migration**: Transitioning from React context provider to nanostores for improved performance and state management
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Adding comprehensive unit tests for theme functionality, preset validation, and component behavior
- **Developer Documentation**: Creating detailed documentation for adding new theme presets, including guidelines and best practices

## Project Evolution

### Key Decisions Made

- **Theme Preset Focus**: Specialized for shadcn/ui theming vs generic React theming
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Runtime theme switching without page reloads
- **Tree-Shaking First**: Individual theme exports to minimize bundle impact
- **Peer Dependencies**: React and shadcn/ui as peer dependencies to avoid version conflicts
- **Nano Stores**: Lightweight state management for theme persistence
- **Runtime Validation**: Peer dependency checks to provide helpful error messages

### Learnings and Insights

- **Theme Switching Performance**: CSS custom properties enable instant theme changes
- **Peer Dependencies**: Essential for React libraries to prevent version mismatches
- **Theme Composition**: Modular theme structure allows for easy customization
- **Testing Requirements**: Theme components need specialized testing for color and state changes
- **Styling Strategy**: CSS custom properties provide better performance than CSS-in-JS

### Recent Changes

- Migrated from standard-version to release-it for better GitHub integration
- Added comprehensive peer dependency validation with runtime checks
- Enhanced tree-shaking with individual theme exports
- Improved TypeScript configuration for theme preset development
- Added Tailwind CSS v4 support alongside v3 examples
- Implemented proper React Testing Library setup with jsdom
